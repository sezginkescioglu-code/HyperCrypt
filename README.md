# Contributing to HyperCrypt

We highly encourage contributions to HyperSMS; we want to make it as easy and streamlined as possible. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our workflow, please feel free to contact me.

Quite a bit of old code still needs to be cleaned up and refactored, so keep that in mind as you're digging through the source. If you find something that's just really not necessary, let me know and I'll put it higher up on my list of stuff to clean up. I'll be focusing on improving code quality of existing code over the next couple weeks.


### Development

We encourage you to make pull requests. Whenever you make one, we'll review the code and test it to make sure that it fits the code style guidelines, and achieves what the pull request intends. We'll discuss any problems or potential improvements, and we'll merge it when we're both (or any number of willing participants) happy with the code.

If you're new, we recommend that you look through the issues and try to fix some of the more simple sounding bugs to familiarize yourself with the codebase.

If you'd like to work on a new feature, please create an issue so we can discuss the idea together before implementation begins.

To learn about pull requests, please refer to the following guide: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/.


# Bug Reports / Feature Requests

We track issues and feature requests using GitHub issues. You can view existing issues and create your own here: https://github.com/sezginkescioglu-code/HyperCrypt/issues


#### Reporting bugs
A great bug report contains a description of the problem and steps to reproduce the problem. We need to know what we're looking for and where to look for it. If the HyperSMS team can't reproduce a bug, we will work with testers to fix the problem.

Bugs are given the red `bug` label. Bugs also may be given extra orange labels:

`needs-info`: We need a better description of the problem.  
`needs-repro`: We need someone who can reproduce the issue consistently.  
`needs-review`: We need someone to verify that the bug has been squashed.

##### Example bug report submission
> *This is a real bug as of the time of writing. Try reproducing it!*
